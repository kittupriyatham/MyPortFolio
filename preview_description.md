# Skills Visualization Preview

## Overview
I've created a chemical compound-style visualization for your skills as requested. This visualization represents your skills as interconnected nodes in a molecular structure, with core competencies as central elements and related skills connected to them.

## Visual Design
The visualization will look like this:

- **Core Competencies** (Software Development, Data Science, Machine Learning, AI, Quantum Computing) are represented as large blue circles positioned strategically across the visualization.
- **Technical Skills** (Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) are represented as medium-sized green circles connected to their related core competencies.
- **Soft Skills** (Problem-solving, Adaptability, etc.) are represented as yellow circles connected to their related core competencies.
- All connections are represented as lines (edges) between the nodes, with the color matching the source skill type.

## Interactive Features
The visualization includes several interactive features:

1. **Hover Effects**: When you hover over any skill, it will highlight and slightly enlarge. All its connections and connected skills will also highlight.
2. **Zoom and Pan**: You can zoom in/out using the mouse wheel and pan around by clicking and dragging.
3. **Responsive Design**: The visualization will adjust to different screen sizes.
4. **Dark Mode Support**: The visualization will automatically adapt to dark mode if your system preferences are set to dark mode.

## Animation Effects
To enhance the chemical compound feel:

1. **Pulsing Animation**: Core competencies have a subtle pulsing animation, similar to how atoms might appear in a molecular visualization.
2. **3D Effect**: Nodes have a subtle shadow to give them a three-dimensional appearance.

## Legend
A legend in the top-left corner explains the color coding:
- Blue: Core Competencies
- Green: Technical Skills
- Yellow: Soft Skills

## Implementation Details
The visualization is implemented using:
- SVG for the graphics
- JavaScript for the interactivity
- CSS for styling and animations

All skills from your original list are included and categorized appropriately.

## Next Steps
If you approve this design, I'll finalize the implementation. If you'd like any adjustments to the design, colors, or interactions, please let me know.
